📜 Voynich Manuscript Structural Analysis
=========================================

🔍 Overview
-----------

This started as a personal challenge to figure out what modern NLP could tell us about the Voynich Manuscript — without falling into translation speculation or pattern hallucination. I'm not a linguist or cryptographer. I just wanted to see if something as strange as Voynichese would hold up under real language modeling: clustering, POS inference, Markov transitions, and section-specific patterns.

Spoiler: it kinda did.

This repo walks through everything — from suffix stripping to SBERT embeddings to building a lexicon hypothesis. No magic, no GPT guessing. Just a skeptical test of whether the manuscript has *structure that behaves like language*, even if we don’t know what it’s saying.

🧠 Why This Matters
-------------------

The Voynich Manuscript remains undeciphered, with no agreed linguistic or cryptographic solution. Traditional analyses often fall into two camps: _statistical entropy checks_ or _wild guesswork_. This project offers a middle path — using computational linguistics to assess whether the manuscript encodes real, structured language-like behavior.

✅ Key Contributions
-------------------

*   Clustering of stripped root words using multilingual SBERT
*   Identification of function-word-like vs. content-word-like clusters
*   Markov-style transition modeling of cluster sequences
*   Folio-based syntactic structure mapping (Botanical, Biological, etc.)
*   Generation of a data-driven lexicon hypothesis table

🔧 Preprocessing Choices
-------------------
One of the most important assumptions I made was about how to handle the Voynich words before clustering. Specifically: I stripped a set of recurring suffix-like endings from each word — things like aiin, dy, chy, and similar variants. The goal was to isolate what looked like root forms that repeated with variation, under the assumption that these suffixes might be:

*   Phonetic padding
*   Grammatical particles
*   Chant-like or mnemonic repetition
*   Or… just noise

This definitely improved the clustering behavior — similar stems grouped more tightly, and the transition matrix showed cleaner structural patterns. But it's also a strong preprocessing decision that may have: 

*   Removed actual morphological information
*   Disguised meaningful inflectional variants
*   Introduced a bias toward function over content

So it’s not neutral — it helped, but it also shaped the results.
If someone wants to fork this repo and re-run the pipeline without suffix stripping — or treat suffixes as their own token class — I’d be genuinely interested in the comparison.

📈 Key Findings
---------------

*   **Cluster 8** exhibits high frequency, low diversity, and frequent line-starts — likely a _function word group_
*   **Cluster 3** has high diversity and flexible positioning — likely a _root content class_
*   **Transition matrix** shows strong internal structure, far from random
*   Cluster usage and POS patterns differ by _manuscript section_ (e.g., Biological vs Botanical)

* * *

🧬 Hypothesis
-------------

The manuscript encodes a structured constructed or mnemonic language using syllabic padding and positional repetition. It exhibits syntax, function/content separation, and section-aware linguistic shifts — even in the absence of direct translation.

📌 Limitations
--------------

*   Cluster-to-word mappings are indirect — frequency estimates may overlap
*   Suffix stripping is heuristic and may remove meaningful endings
*   No semantic translation attempted — only structural modeling

✍️ Authors Note
--------------
This project was built as a way to learn — about AI, NLP, and how far structured analysis can get you without assuming what you're looking at. I’m not here to crack the Voynich. But I do believe that modeling its structure with modern tools is a better path than either wishful translation or academic dismissal.

So if you're here for a Rosetta Stone, you're out of luck.

If you're here to model a language that may not want to be modeled — welcome.
